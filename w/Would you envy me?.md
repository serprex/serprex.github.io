Could you trust him? You'd never know him<br>
He'd take you in the night, without a fight<br>
Masquarade parties for perverted fucks<br>
You'd never know them<br>

He'll take you by the waist, tell you all he's faced<br>
Could you trust him? You'll never know him<br>
Gawdy ballerinas for highclass punks<br>
They'll chase you down<br>

He'll pawn you off to me<br>
Did you trust him? You shouldn't trust me<br>
I'm a perverted punk, not out to give highclass fucks<br>
You'll call for them<br>

You'll face all I face<br>
You'll fight all I fight<br>
We'll be tied by waist all throughout the night<br>
We'll fight them off, face to face<br>
