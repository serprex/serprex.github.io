*Hi Hello How are you I'm well. She seemed too happy in such brief a crossing of crossroads, but that's how people are when waving to strange strangers 08:03, March 12, 2011 (UTC)*

Hung on a hook to sag, you'll make sure not to miss the fresh meat to serve<br>
Out to challenge the world, you'll struggle to leap the puddle to swing<br>
When moments last, they never do<br>
Offer a queen what she deserves, a cheer to nothing<br>
Silence on the set, out out out, quiet yourself, stay awhile, pass the tea, do you mind?<br>
That's enough, really it is<br>

On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me fuck off<br>
Binge to the fullest so that when it's all over you see how to reduce it in the future<br>
In the future the past will be reduced<br>

Getting it all right is alright, but this decorative sheath must be pulled back for the truer strike<br>
Learn to mount lies in honesty, or dismount and bear bare arms<br>

Allow me the liberty of the former: The correlation of random points is found through a convex hull<br>
Now allow me no further liberties<br>
But one more? To please? Before the end is through<br>

A final moment<br>
One that knows it won't last<br>
All I ask<br>
& more<br>
