I fell

Now I'm here

There's a flower. Jaune. A single petal

& a watering can thrown against the wall. Aluminum and plain besides a head to spread the stream. The handle is rather bent

Walls are a dull concrete. There's a tap at one end

The flower's weeping dry: Water me... one more time?

I keep still. How did I end up here? Things were going so well

A sigh, or a rasp? Water me... one more time?

Alright. I recover the watering can, bring it to the tap, turn on the tap, fill it a little, walk over to the flower, and water it

It dances in the sprinkle

Thank you sir

How nice. I nod my head and walk away to take a look at my bleak surroundings

Then I hear, all cuddly and cute: Water me... one more time?

Go away. I don't want to be here. I'm lost

Drooping itself: Water me... one more time?

Shut up. I need to figure out where I am. I'm busy. Go find someone else to flower you

It curls nearer me. Growing paler as it stretchs itself, a still paler voice: Water me... one more time?

I don't know you. Get away from me. I've never seen you in my life

It's wrapping around me, shrill cries crying: Water me... one more time?

Alright. It shrinks back. I recover the watering can, bring it to the tap, wipe the sweat from my brow, turn on the tap, fill it a little, toss some water in my face, walk over to the flower, and water it

Thank you sir

This time around I keep my eyes on it. It shyly curls itself, head tilted away. We hold still a moment, before it uncurls itself and faces me again: Water me... one more time?

No / Please? / No / Pretty please? / No / Pretty please with a cherry on top? / No

It's slithering towards me again. Away you devilish thing! Throwing the water can, it bats it back into my face. Hard enough to knock me back. I look up, it's doing that shy curl look again. Whiny bitch, I'll get you water

I pull my fly, but find that I'ven't a need

Sorry, no water / Water me... one more time?

That's it. I move towards the flower, reaching to deroot it from this concrete, but a moment later I step back upon feeling the stem's burn of microscopic thorns. Nasty bitch. An attempt to kick the thing leaves me tripped on the floor. I don't feel like getting up again

The flower is crawling up my leg: Water me... one more time?

How insatiable the thirst. My hand is burning. My leg is going numb. I feel thirsty. It's wrapping my body. Caressing my chin. Holding me so tightly

Thank you sir
