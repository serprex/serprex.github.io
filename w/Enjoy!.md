*Somehow I feel it lends itself to [The Kills's What New York Used to Be](https://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/The_Kills:What_New_York_Used_To_Be) 18:59, January 10, 2011 (UTC)*

Still life stop motion<br>
Forsooth, a day, a night, but alas, more<br>
Mise en abyme, the timeless nature of time past and future<br>
Steps behind, watching steps ahead, tripped<br>

Decapitated head stand<br>
Behind met, ahead gone, it never happens<br>
Old men coming out of taxis stumble for no one<br>
They have no future for their past<br>

Somewhere, she left me<br>
I awoke, I slept, I dared<br>
Hold the day through the night<br>
What freed my day bound my night<br>

I will not be bound: What began then, ended then. It shouldn't have been, but it will forever be. This riddled state, it is but a small price. The circumstances which call one to stand a night, surely it must be a greater day than any day which leaves us trying the next?<br>

Listen to my words, not me. Judge me knowing this: I'd do it again<br>
