*I said I started writing poetry, but that I wouldn't be able to write anything long like they use to. I need to contradict myself more, so this is the attempt 22:24, February 25, 2011 (UTC)*

Sniffle sniffle is how it starts<br>
Achoo achoo is how it smarts<br>
Cart the bodies, row by row<br>
Reaped, and so we sow<br>
Babes are born with the disease<br>
Cows give milk more sour than cheese<br>

No man is island<br>
All men are dying to die<br>
Who is immune?<br>

We want blood<br>
Everyone is changing<br>
Ravenous all night<br>
Everyone is dying<br>
Where is heaven?<br>
Only God knows<br>
Lonesome for someone<br>
Fuck the world<br>

Walk by night<br>
Sleep by day<br>
Lose every fight<br>
Dead by May<br>

Some go out to find doctors<br>
Some stay in to die by a fire<br>
Some get blamed with a pyre<br>
Some still work their tractor<br>

We pray every night, that someone else is immune<br>
That someone else won't cry to the moon<br>
That someone else might cure us soon<br>

Might this barren land bear snow?<br>
Is there no news bearing west?<br>
We reap nothing of what we sow<br>
So half ran east, and a quarter took eternal rest<br>
The other quarter? Bore north<br>
I've been their unsuspected guest<br>
When they tary, I drive them forth<br>
I've elected them to my quest<br>
I've got until next month's fourth<br>
The fifth is either my triumph, or my funeral<br>
If they prove hardier than their bravery, it'll be my triumph<br>
They're certainly brave; they'll only lose by force<br>
My intent are my respite; for now my deeds are only viral<br>
By the load, humph<br>

It happened during the night<br>
He stood across a wolf held at bay<br>
He lasted the fight,<br>
but a single scratch marked his final day<br>
He had two choices:<br>
to live on and die,<br>
or die with a try<br>
He need only listen to the sheperd's voice<br>
*Sheep fear men dressed as wolves*<br>
*Men fear wolves dressed as sheep*<br>
*Wolves fear sheep dressed as men*<br>
By fear, he took the sheep<br>
By pride, he made them men<br>
By hunger, he'd slay the wolves<br>

There was a wolf who dressed as a woman<br>
Nobody feared her; nobody saw<br>
She saw their plight, their flaw<br>
She brought the king as a man<br>
She was there when it began<br>
She would watch it withdraw<br>
It was the course of law<br>
The age of man faced its ban<br>

For he listened with two ears<br>
Collecting wisdom before years<br>

Half went east<br>
Half of that half died<br>
The rest weren't so lucky in the least<br>
They yearned for a feast<br>
They'd kept the north eyed<br>
Looking wearily for before, but now they were the beasts<br>

Insatiable benalities<br>
Unjust realities<br>
The den grew close<br>
The men did not repose<br>
The heart of man's mother<br>
Stolen by his brothers<br>

At the summit,<br>
they grew lust for blood,<br>
but alas, struck by a flood<br>
of fur, from the east<br>
They earned their feast<br>
Hope fell a high plummet<br>

They were now sure<br>
that there was no cure<br>
