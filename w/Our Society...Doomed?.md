A laugh sprang throughout the field

The laugh was one of mischief, it made all who heard it yield

## 5W
### Senile Toads...
That old toad,

jumps over puddles which are at least 3% algea,but no more then 10% algea and have a minimum diameter of half its circumference,

in areas within 10 kilometers, but no closer than 2 kilometers of an altitude equal to the longitude which when multiplied are multiples of 4,

on every other even-dayed Wednesday, in odd months of years, who are of a multiple of seven for the last three digits...

because he is old, crazy and bored...
## I do not understand...
### Human Nature
I do not understand how disputes between nations must lead to violence

I do not understand how nations must compete for resources and let the weak die

I do not understand how we can let the weak die and only give them a word of gratitude,yet nothing they need

I do not understand how those with what the weak need can just throw it away,too hard is it to give

But I do understand that those with power do what I don't understand because they can't share their power
## Narrative
### Zap's Tap
Zap had a broken tap

Zap's tap wrecked his cheesy wrap

Zap couldn't take eating wet cheese!

Zap just couldn't take it...

Zap was gonna snap!!!

Zap was zapped...
### Nuclear Scars
Metallic signs lay about, half melted by the radiation blazing about...

Roads lay shattered, carbon bodies burnt against them...

Buildings lay on the ground, any left were shattered along the horizon...

Forests lay scorched and cut,dry ponds lay filled with dead fish...

The sky above rained with black rain, poisoning all it embraced...

All this,flooded by the heat...

Why?

All this destruction lay buried beneath the now raised sea...

If only humanity had not learned the power of the atom...

Why?

All this,for power...

All this destruction painted across this small world...

Drifting,it now lay dead...

If only humanity had never built steel...

Or their society...

Or their intelligence and greed...

If only humanity had not wished for more...

Maybe then, this would not have occured...

Maybe then, the hands of the dead would not be stained red...

Why?

Because if evil truly exists, it would be humanity...

Because if greed truly exists, it would be humanity...

Because the need for power can never be met...

And this is what lay behind us now...

A dead civillisation of chaos lay buried beneath the sea, shattered by the ones who created it...

Why?

For that, is all we can ask...
## Terza Rima
### War
The sun shone down

Why must it be today?

A road lay ahead, we were to sew death's gown

I stared down at my array

What power I faced, what power I held

What we held would let out death's ray

Blasts spread though, blood and dirt began to meld

What we had called forth was terrible

It all began to weld
## Free Verse

Because?

Rules

It is a bit more of a [philosophy](https://fiction.wikia.com/wiki/wikipedia:Mise en abyme), it states one motive and it talks of itself, such there is not a single rule

Name:???
### The Deck of Life
Deals are dealt constantly, and we must play with what we get.

-Such vexs us and we are left abash.

--For those dealt well have power with the cards they hold.

---But those not dealt well have no powers, no trumps to play.

---So why do we still play? Why do we take the cards in this way?

--Could we not decide to play another hand, to pass? Must they be left in the cold?

-Why are the odds so vast? Those with a bad deal can only cheat to win, could they not be given the cash?

For all with a good hand, had to cheat for it. So this game we play is the cheater's game, any who act by the rules set will only lose. We play the game of Life, and it plays with many decks. We all have to try get what we can get, for that is the only way that we can get into the elites, who have made a very unfair bet.
