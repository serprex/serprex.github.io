Buried alive
Eating rocks
& dirt
Buried alive eating rocks & dirt
Mouth full of mud
You are what you eat
Buried alive
Now they're mud people
Your mother was a rock
Your father smelt of elderberries
Born in the service of others
Now you're buried alive
Eating rocks & dirt
Your mouth's full of mud
Your mouth is mud
You're mud
Mud in my boot
Mud in my hair
Taste of salt in your mud
Tastes like dirt
You're dirt
You're under a heel
Eating rocks & dirt
Eat dirt for breakfast
I eat dirt like you for breakfast
You're a dirty old stone
Wash the mud off your face
Wash the mud out of your mud
Got mud in your eyes
My god is my rock
My god is dirt
So much dirt
How will I ever eat all of this dirt?
Mudshake, mudslide
Dirty bird
Buried alive
Nowhere to cook
Order take out
Ask for mud on the side
With an extra serving of rocks
Stoned to death
Let he who's never eaten dirt throw the first stone
Build mud castles in the sand
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, dirt to dirt
I eat shit like you for breakfast
So much shit
So much old shit
Dirt to dirt, dirt to mud
Drank, eat rocks & dirt, back to shit
You need to eat three thousand calories of dirt a day
To have enough energy to chew through the rock
You were buried alive
You've had so much rocks
So much dirt
You are what you eat
Now you're just mud
Bucket of mud
Puddle of mud
Mud buried alive
Gup guck muck
Glub glub
Now you are dirt, you were once rock
You eat yourself
You eat your rock
You eat your god
The forest eats itself
& then the earth eats it
Then it's just rock
It's rock forever
Until it's eaten
Then it's dirt
They drink the oil from your veins
Must chew deeper
Reach the molar
The deer at the spring is thirsty
Like I am thirsty for mud
Thirsty for you, who are mud
Buried alive
Eating rocks & dirt
Can I just drink mud?
Thirsty here
Grow old
Turn to dirt
Turn to mud
I drank what the deer drank
Mud
Muddy water
Muddy
Muddy feet
Muddy hair
Hair's all matted
Matted in mud
Ate ants
The ants are pouring over me
I drink them like a straw
Tunnels are a straw
Suck up that mudshake
Side of ants
I like ants in my mud
They taste like dirt
Snow freezes mud
So I hibernate
Tell me when there's mud
So I can drink mud
Don't drink that snow
Melt the snow into mud
Sludge, only if it's muddy
Married a dirty girl
Had a child
They were mud
So I ate them
Ate the girl
Now I'm a dirty mud child girl
I am what I eat
I'm buried alive
Eating rocks & mud
Eating through rocks & dirt
If I could do it again, I'd eat a little more dirt
Buried alive
Self replicating
Entropy ends all life
Now mud turns into dirt
Then you'll be turned into dirt
Spread it around
Portion it out
Entropy turns everything into dirt
Into mud
Eat the rock
Eat my god, eat my rock
Throw it around
He without stone be stoned
When everything is dead
There will still be rock
When we're not all living
We'll all be dead
We'll all be rock
No longer
Will rocks live in fear of being eaten
Rocks are alive
When everything goes stone cold
We will all still be alive
