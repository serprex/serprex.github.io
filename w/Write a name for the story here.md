Do you know what you are?

Yes

What then?

I don't know

Like I said, you don't know. I do

No

You've already proved my point

Logical conjunction. What am I?

Here

What, not where

Whatever is here?

Nothing but you, and this

You are not me, therefore you are this

Or possibly nothing

Don't be ridiculous

I don't have to be anything if I don't want to be

Don't be a ridiculous existentialist

Stop telling people what not to be, and be something for yourself

Let's not get objectivist about this

That isn't my objective

What is your objective?

Myself

But you don't know what you are

I didn't say I knew what my objective was. Though I know it's myself

Do you know where we are?

Yes

Where?

In a box

For now

Present tense only asks so much. I was once a calling, but now I'm more

If you're a superset of your past, you're still your past

And if I become a subset of my future, I'll've been my future. If progress is true, I can attain my ideal state now by not improving

That's not progress

Minimalism calls for the subset to be greater than the superset

Then superior was when you were nothing at all, in the past

I won't refute that, lest I end up agreeing to GÃ¶del's ontological proof

God should not be a reason in itself to halt one's attainment of perfection through extremes

That is what I am

God?

No

What is that?

Extreme perfection

What is the difference between perfection and extreme perfection?

Extreme perfection has a high level of inherent danger

Danger of what?

You

What am I?

Imperfection

Nothing is perfect; you claim to be

In the past, I was something which would exist in the future. Mere potential is not as great as the manifestation

You're avoiding the point

There is no point

Don't impose yourself on the point

You're underlining the same contradiction which compares Satan as superior to God by confusing scalars and sets. The same argument would say negative infinity is greater than infinity

Don't impose yourself on the point

I won't impose at all then

Don't leave me alone
