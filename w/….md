The ellipsis is insufficient for describing all the variants of silence

Staring at the ceiling awake at night

Watching the sun rise while waiting for a bus

Oscilliating between left & right eye while shifting head about looking at the specular reflection of chandelier lights alter between appearing double & being merged by optical illusion

Smirking face to face with nothing to say

Idle eyes on idle traffic

Prolonged blink in midst of keyboard fatigue

Pouring tea

Stirring tea

Blowing the heat off the top of tea

Tensing of body in mimicking squirrels

Thinking back over what to say to what's been said

Reflecting on which coincidences consequently produced this moment

Staring out a window any time any day

Waiting for a traffic light

Waiting, waiting, waiting

Silence enters the mind, patiently drawing a blank

Blurred thoughts while reading, losing track of the words, losing track of the thoughts

While loading laundry

Waiting for the piss to break

Waiting for others to finish grace

Standing for a minute of silence

Time out in the corner

Exam writing

Small sounds escape the silence: clicking of a joystick during early morning gaming on mute, traffic, pouring slowly raising in pitch as the cup becomes full, breathing, swallowing, wetting of lips, clothes tumbling into the washer, squirrels climbing up trees, urban seagulls far adrift from sea bringing sounds of the beach, the humming of a fan, the scratching of pens or pencils, the clicking of a keyboard, the shifting of weight brining out a squeak from a chair, footsteps

These are not words
