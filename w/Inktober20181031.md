Last day October rains warmth and chill no sweat drip drip drip......

Drank til last drop, hung behind yard, thumb bound, like a girl out of shoes, breathing down my neck

Pull line, draped over eyes, only eye, peephole, streetfare, repercussion, kid to the slaughter, housed five

Still staring back blinded to heaving breathing saying tomorrow's embers burn today sweat breaking brow

walk these footsteps pathing walk on where once fro now bring me my sweet alibi to lay rest the guilty

Lighten up, it's a little late to be picking out any rings, sought timeless mirage off banks & bludgeoned red coats

in the upper room they're still dancing like entropy hasn't a care nor fuck to give given the circumstances where they stand

used to sit & watch the rain I hear drip drip drip in my skull slushes it side to side giving pained birth infection drip drip drip

when I think of what other people think I think a cloud because there are plenty of clouds to think about everyday or night

sometimes I stop & watch a cat stop along the way looking into looking out giving out bits of scrap like a new age edifice

washed up something hollow & inscribed fro years of abuse under lime lit hallway gatherings ushering in some grand exeunt

As if this warmth is being poured down this bottomless pit out of which grows putrid things like fighting words & resting bitch face & taste of drip drip drip licking open eye lids

Quand je pense qu'ils vont trouver leur place, je pense que j'ai quelque chose lourd comme dans une tempête ou la coeur d'hiver année après année

Sketched in ink drip drip drip long heel of the law open mouth fed open eyes in handfuls boxed eats shoots & leaves lining axes that way

Prey witness this haze these days I've been a bad girl, boy you'd like to know, this hill I die on: correct use of good... drip drip drip

... A nothingness is. Spread me out limb by limb, tell me what little girls are made of, photosynthesis & vodka? More empty skulls for the fucking drip drip drip

Mais c'est mon nom, m'écoutes? J'attends drip drip drip la peste d'une plage vient de souvenir toutes les fois qu'on pense drip drip drip...

drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... drip drip drip... 

Honest tho it's like fifteen minutes a line while flipping through flops til I hear my next line wanting me like fruit flies want my drip drip drip

Bring out the hack saw, the wretch, they'll wander through town leaving drip drip drip wherefore they pass, even when we shake our heads

Smelt in wine, words unsheathed, carried home with us, some broth to ladle away the day, feast upon coming dusk

Grown throughout year, a new leaf, ripe for plucking, discarded pile, heap on floor, empty quiver, stone cold, drip drip drip, growing colder

Immune to my nefarious affects, nebulous onsets. Deaf to my drip drip won't you be my drip drip drip? Harest my aflatoxins as they bloom

Harvest plenty spoil, wrapped safe behind foil, incubated from shit to learn, all the shit they say, everything in order out of place

wittled til brittle, osteoporosis shaking me to the bone, all that's left leaving drip drip drip behind is hung to dry under wrong sun

Feeling flesh from tendrils finding touch too taxing for finger for fang thankless funk fought through fenced tombs

Outstretched prosthetic burned once burnt lesson fat chance fizzing over fire droplets drip drip drip across your face

Feel this pulse? Thump felt drip drip drip... drip drip drip... so consistent it feels as tho it'll drip drip drip forever, has already forever

As if out of sequence, been experiencing déjà vu more often. All of a sudden present doesn't seem so sudden, moments blending

C'est quand on sais la peur qu'on ne sais plus encore. Il y a trop de chose pour nettoyer. Dans ce moment je veux mon mouchoir

Avec mon mouchoir noir j'ai nettoyé mon bain, maintenant blanche et noir, ni crasse reste, tous comme fleuve drip drip drip

walking toe to heel. Limping past yielded traffic. A million traffic lights falling out of phase. We stop to watch them flicker

when I think of wood I think of green beecause it reads "tap for green dot drip drip drip" resulting in daily products like

Once was heard... in silence dust collects, in corners of my mind, a wheezing cackle rattling from within looking out

Chewing away dust collected under fingernails, drip drip drip away blood from these hands, blood in all our hands

Seeing girls looking like me looking like trash in trance where claws retract in thoroughfare waiting for another

Wipe dust from shoes, socks, sandles, feet, back, floor, brow... Wipe that shit off your chest, paddle forward

when I see a cyclops I think of my face because I see it can be torn of plenty to become more complete

There are rational pitfalls, holes scattered like ellipses in a girl's blossoming deep thoughts, uncomputable...

Ripped to shreds, marrow sucked dry, eventually the entropy we exhaust is inhaled, thus is karma, thus drip drip drip

Climbing thru where once was green, now slivers count my transgression, ebb & flow drip drip drip as it comes rising chin deep

Slipping on every step, this past Winter didn't have any falls, year before learnt this body's youth is drip drip drip mortality grins

Pass the glass, to cheer another is to test fortune, conspire against inevitable, propagation of this dull bargain

Tease away dandruff scratching at door asking "please oh won't you open your mouth & taste drip drip drip?"

Stiff joints loosening this soliloquy, exhuming tightly knit covers, peels membrane, away everything goes, sleep flush

Green's gone grey, rings sighted, signage disposed, here now's dispossessed, yearning back to thinking never might

Look up to keep breathing, see what's up, as if some new direction, sore neck, tendons growing stale, yum crispy

Nails keep growing, hair keeps growing, til eventually tapped, out of touch, forgotten how to expel decay, it has waited

What's to be done with the cupy? Ce n'est pas vide. Water sends a chill through this body. C'est vide...

Man does not live on bread alone, lives on feet, at least once ago... now man is bread, living alone. Toasted

Catalyst or cataclysm? All began with drip drip drip, like some jamming signal, or inducing signal. Fixation production

No excuses for all this guilt strewn madness, intentional delusions, every rainy October day, something smiles

Came in drip drip drip wet from morning routine, dressed in pink toe to head, wrapped in black grief

When I'm lost I think I'm out of my depth like I'm out of ideas because an idea finds itself at home in mind

Please sign in the blank provuded où c'est vide, mais il ne vais pas être vide quand tu écris ton nom within the lines drawn in the sand, here your name is sanctioned, nowhere else, it is amancipated henceforth, free your deeds & misdemeanor. Forever more when others see you walking by in the street they'll recognize you by the drip drip drip leading & pursuing your march through mud & weeds & fire... drip drip drip... drip drip drip...
