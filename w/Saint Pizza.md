That'll be twenty two oh two / ...you're kidding / Is there a problem? / I just gave you twenty two oh two / That'll be twenty two oh two / I've already paid / No, you have not paid for your order as of yet

Cue a straight backed tug of war

Fine! Here's twenty two oh two / Thank you, that'll be twenty two oh two / For fucks sake, what's your problem? You've already robbed me twenty two oh two, now you want forty four oh four? / No sir, your order is only twenty two oh two / How do you not get curb stomped after work, is this how you treat most customers? / We take pride in making a perfect pizza and providing courteous and helpful service on time, all the time. Every customer says, "I'll be back!" / Yeah, well, I'll be back! ...to slit your throat / Please refrain from violent threats

Recycled garbage, twice used but never fulfilled

The return trip always passes faster. Revision lacks resolution

Where's pizza? / Got gypped / Where's pizza? / I didn't get it! / Why not? / Got gypped, guy just kept asking for twenty two oh two

Sequence skip. Silence to groans

Throat not slit, but body clubbed. Where's pizza?

Save the pizza, steal from the devourers, give to the pizza / Do you know how important it is to me to get this pizza? To bring it home for sacrificial offering? This is self preservation

Pizza won't save you now

Throat slit
