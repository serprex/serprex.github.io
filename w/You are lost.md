*081009. Titled by another. Written in response to their writing a sonnet (They were taking the data mining route. "Time right now consists of writing a sonnet. Shakespeare wasn't all too brilliant in doing so. The task that is most tedious is counting syllables. I find it brings no flow. It's simply to constrict, perhaps he found it fun") 16:40, January 16, 2011 (UTC)*

Silly things miscount dialect<br>
Elsewhere speaks with stresses all lacing<br>
Elsewhere speaks with stresses all racing<br>
Too grand. Too unknown. Too derelict<br>
All so brilliant and all so direct<br>
Constraints to the sea: they're chasing<br>
Constraints to the moon: they'll sing<br>
Child's play, loosly sparse in collect<br>
Find it all fun, but don't get lost<br>
If it isn't fun, then it is done<br>
Constrain further, dear masochist<br>
The small beat of it is frost<br>
The large beat of it is fun<br>
Always rhyme spite, masochist<br>
