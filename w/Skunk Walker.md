*For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night*

2300

*Now I'm gonna pack my things and go*

Off the hook

Off the shelf

Out the door

Left foot laced

Right foot laced

Out the door

Keys out

Door locked

Downstairs

Through gate, opened closed

Cut left

Blocks pass

Black cat watching from steps

Over shoulder

Blocks pass

*Seems to go nowhere*

Skunk smell

Black cat crossing path. Or not

Stand. *Once I ran to you*

White breaks ahead

Woman follows on a leash

*Run away, I've got to*

Wait

Scratching against the tar road

The woman begins chittering

*Now I'll run from you*

Into a tree

Slow run

"You have to make noise"

"They're blind"

"What?"

"They're blind at night. You have to make noise"

Barking

*Don't touch me, please*

"Like that"

"Don't know why. Yeah, like that"

"Good evening"

Scurry past

Between a rock & a hard place

Humming rising

*Sometimes I feel I've got to*

Open field

Onwards leftward

Cars behind

Road ahead

Tall trees

Leaves all across the path

No more cracks to mark steps in time

Tempos all off

Figure in distance

Just a sign

Off on right, another scurrying

White tip

Walking away

Groveling away

Bridge walk is decently separated, fence's tall

Walk cross

Note passage over fence

Over, round round, not so tall

Stepping from rock to rock, up rock by rock

Outside of fence comes out, goes in

Walk around pole, walk cross

Figure in distance

Young cane

Walk on by

Caning the path

Walk on by

Parking lot

Skunk from before's prowling the field

Chip stand's closed

Earth's dug up, ad hoc parking lot, soon to be new, newer than new

Caning up that hill

Stand, spinning, slow spin, kicking debris

*Get away*

Worry about dropping through bushes, in case of skunk, walk on, figuring a third crossing's due

*You don't really want any more from me*

As expected

Veer left, they're right, downhill

Wall to the left, water to the right

*And I've lost my light*

Light breaks, drop right, down an unlit path

Worrying about skunk nests

Sewage smell

Around, look up, high branch over river, roots slow rise

Climb up, twig up straight some illusion of support, gloves tract

Girth is wide, doubly so, but balance is off

*You need someone to hold you tight*

Hop down

Awkward thing

Cat stuck in a tree

Foot back on the twig

Drop

Worry about landing on a skunk

*I cannot stand the way you tease*

Saunter off

Worry about running into a skunk in passing a bush imposing itself into sidewalk

Cross to side without a sidewalk

Against traffic

Hearing traffic approach from behind

Never noticed it past

Key's won't give, checking for scratched up nail polish

*I give you all a boy could give you*

Just won't give, either way around

Push & pull

They give

Kick shoes off
