*I'm not very charming 02:13, August 16, 2011 (UTC)*

Or as she said, "I'm not very proper"

Four four time

Tick tock tick tock

Tikt tack took bang

If I write it once, it's shoved up and cranked to hear. If I write it twice, it's chorus pulled by the ear

If I write it once, it's shoved up and cranked to hear. If I write it twice, it's chorus pulled by the ear

There's a trick I've found to rhyming: Choose the second word first

All these speakers talking with a slouch to their left. Best write from the right, as is right despite fright, one must defy rite to appear bright, but remain trite if humor might be light or slight or shite. Don't fight at its height, but keep the tension tight

What a blight to language that practice is

If I write it once, it's shoved up and cranked to hear. If I write it twice, it's chorus pulled by the ear

If I write it once, it's shoved up and cranked to hear. If I write it twice, it's chorus pulled by the ear

If I write it thrice: no dice. This is four for four, so one more, we've almost made it to shore

Hope you caught that left slouch. Compare: Paddle on fore, we've almost made it to shore. It's all about aftertaste

Also it forces a little bit of thinking before you speak, a mind tweak most leave for conspiracy freaks that reak of thinking too much to the right to take a moment thinking about how it starts on the left to begin with. Fallacies that leak have the habit to sneak up on those who seek

If I write it once, it's shoved up and cranked to hear

This could go on all week. Apologies, I just had to get that weak

If I write it twice, it's chorus pulled by the ear

I can get weaker. I said that to two too. Told you I could get weaker

If I write it thrice: no dice. This is four for four, so one more, we've almost made it to shore

But everyone's hustling mics for calling pikes to tell witches to take a hike like they did kikes and the like. See that? I refused to say bike

If I write it fright, all is right. Too bad

Thus ends the second part. Short, I know, but the first was so much more fair that I couldn't bare such further

Thus we return to the continuum: A Knight's Left Sword. A play on sinister. I'm unsure of when I'll take up this sharp line. I've taken up the King's Gambit. I haven't actually played it with anyone though, since I haven't played anyone since I've taken it up. Blame Yabause: it got me playing Radiant Silvergun. The ironically ironic virtues are quite nice, especially given the broken English: Be attitude for gains

What a blight to language that practice is

If you give someone time, you gotta give them space

If I write it once, it's shoved up and cranked to hear. If I write it twice, it's chorus pulled by the ear

If I write it once, it's shoved up and cranked to hear. If I write it twice, it's chorus pulled by the ear

Also in queue: Surprix. Queue itself makes data structures much more entertaining when the French slang is known, but the point here is that surprix, when pronounced through English means, homonymizes with my handle. It's about time I confess to how overpriced I am. As always, with as much double entendre as I can muster to fluster to hoist her. Long? I know. And so that ends where it began. Pushed at the beginning to pop at the end, it's a stack waiting in line. In queue. Stacks and queues: double ended queue

Oh ho oh oh. & people try to tell me my field is boring

What a clash of styles. But I'll draw on my 3rd try's note on transitions: it's about the composition of what we plagiarize. Composition shows understanding in showing relation

Also: Surprise! Surpris

If I write it once, it's shoved up and cranked to hear. If I write it twice, it's chorus pulled by the ear

If I write it once, it's shoved up and cranked to hear. If I write it twice, it's chorus pulled by the ear

One. Two. Three

& go

Makes four

& that's that

& that's that
