Smooth fold bubbling to surface pop all of my insides come out staining bark motley hues these are my ashes wet and ready ooze leaving goosebumps as hot water runs out droplets collecting down wrinkled toes it all sags water logged dripping porcelain cracks door slides chipped grout looking fogged morning dew pulling leaves collecting rent can't pay these bills chirping echos against bark shit washes down the drain windshield stains outlines of impact thunk a muffled scream but that's not me only a thin veneer except wittled down to fester again here again puff all of my insides not ready but it goes on a swelling wait slowly moment to moment the same swelling or is it worse does it matter everything ennui having to pick which wrapping fits to seize the day or maybe tomorrow when finally I'll burst emptying down the drain keeping tendrils away from all this once was me no longer short stubbly ends in orb like words absorb
