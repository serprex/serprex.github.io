<center>!!!The True Story!!!</center>
:I awoke one morning with my ears in revolting pain, I yelled “OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!”My left ear hurt the most. Then I saw it...An oompa-loompa was diving into my eye, another up my nose, one said with a voice that crackled as low as evil in my ear“I’m Curt! I love to hate you!” I jumped out of bed, but too late Curt had burrowed through my ear and into my BRAIN! I felt a chomp and a thrashing headache, but I had already lost my colour perception, I saw like a dog saw!!! The others wiped their own little rooms in my brain, then I felt the disco music vibrate through my spine and the poor rhythm of their pattering feet, like rain to a fire, I collapsed to the floor.
:I awoke in a pale pink room and a light bulb asked me in a voice as low as evil “I’m going to get you, I already have you!” and then something wobbled towards me and said, with a voice as soft as a brick“If you implode, do you think you’ll explode? I’m Boby!” I yelled “Where am I?” but a little alien dudette said “Would you like some brain pie? I’m Boe! ” I yelled “How am I in myself?!?!?!?!?!?!?” I was shoved into a balloon immediately, and squeezed tightly, I finally imploded and.... BOOM!!!!!!!

I had exploded, I woke up wondering what I would eat in the street... I was now my own parasite...

The End?
