Je suis comme lui qui n'est pas<br>
On to the next<br>
Mais quoi?<br>
On to the next<br>
He's in the ashtray<br>
Back a moment, what?<br>
Forsoo--<br>
Noo!<br>

Time to change back<br>
Plagiarism in the information age is not always a cut and dry issue<br>
Anti life<br>
Okay, now this isn't being so blurry<br>
Catch up; exciting? You are no dog<br>
I'm shouting at you, no shard of a yard stick will sick you, who are indeed a dog, on you<br>
It seems I must reiterate: Time to change back<br>
No. We're not stopping this car. We've nearly caught up with them<br>
I can't hear you; turn the radio off<br>
But it's my favorite program: *Argh, you're listening to 81.3 sound of the sea*<br>
Forsoo--<br>
Noo!<br>

Crackle in the knuckle, popcorn in hand, où maintenant?<br>
Là! Oh la la!<br>
Quiet, knave<br>
Knaves and knights, from so long ago, whence did they come, wherefore shalt they leave?<br>
Thou shalt not shalt your shalls<br>
Where will will suffice<br>
Forsoo--<br>
Noo!<br>

Bugger off, même si c'est vous?<br>
Back a moment, who else am I?<br>
Pas qui, mais quoi<br>
Quit the chicken cluck<br>
Don't treat me like a clock, let's stay high<br>
Higher than that cuckoo nest?<br>
Which cuckoo nest? You?<br>
Me?<br>
Forsoo--<br>
Noo!<br>

Worlds collide<br>
Only at zero<br>
Relatively the same<br>
Only at zero<br>
Two threads of the same rope converge<br>
By both ends, at both ends, for both ends<br>
Forsoo--<br>
Noo!<br>

Quoi?<br>
Always questioning, never answering<br>
C'est toi<br>
You know what happened to Socrates? He died. No man is towering<br>
Il y a des temps à temps quelque fois<br>
Showering away the glory of your tongue<br>
Forsoo--<br>
Noo!<br>
