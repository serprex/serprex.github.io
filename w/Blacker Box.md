Premise: a simulation of a newtonian universe could potentially result in a universe similar our own, but incapable of tapping into the computational efficiencies of quantum computers. To the newtonians our universe would have strange rules, supernatural rules. But they could be accessible if we allowed the simulation an interface outside of itself. Follow on: a simulation of a quantum universe could potentially result in our own universe, yet an interface could be put in which allows us to achieve more efficient computations by tapping into the strange supernatural rules of our simulators' universe. These 'oracle' functionalities would come off as if a diety, breaking our model of computational complexity
