All alone in a crowded train

Doors are now closing. I haven't been on here for so long. Clarkson

Port Credit. Stand clear of the door please. Doors are closing

My neck hurts

I don't have 250 words to say about that guy. He isn't even looking at me. He doesn't care about me. How am I suppose to write 250 words going about how this guy is some other guy when it's clear in 44 words?

Ticket check. Aren't you glad I made you go back? Wrong side. Thanks

Guy refused

You don't see it

5/6. Please keep in mind crossing the tracks is dangerous & illegal. Go Leafs go

This about the city:

I found drinks. Strawberry shake. Nestea. A cold coffee. Mixed some coke and punch found by each other. Bottom of a coke

X files. That's later. First we're walking around walking around and wondering where's where and what's what. I'm wanting French Vanilla and she's wanting to figure out where Chinatown is so we can get go pieces and we're walking and I'm think what's this or that this or that. A thought: In all this, I can't remember every single ad. Every single pretty face on a square. All these people walking. It took too long to break from the crowd. Bubble tea was too expensive. Everywhere's going nowhere. Take out forty I won't spend. Go to work and walk through a puddle with wet feet and don't roll down those rolled down pant legs because that's that and this'll be this. That's not what I'm talking about. Leave and find strawberry shake. It was hard to get in but I'll show you the way out. There's poor busking and cotton candy. The sandwich gets tossed and there goes half my two toonies. There's line ups for photos. Photo's are being taken in front of simple lights and clowns. Finding random coffees and stuff and exhibits and crowds. Crashing them in when going to go. Asian food bought primarily for chicken. Stop in at smoke screens and ice cream. They say thank you I say you're welcome. Banana boat. Climb up. Climb down. Girate to rotate.Wait around. For once not in a crowd. Could I take a piss? Won't til I'm home. I want a soda. Get me a soda. He has a soda. Train's here. I want a soda. Oh my god we're going to miss the train. I got a soda and we didn't miss the train. Twenty minutes to go see the fires start so we didn't go because we'd seen a pile of paper tubes and some guy showing his stuff on the way back and line ups into alleys that are usually empty enough to mug people in. An ambulance is on the way. Jump on the back and jump. He's playing possum. Mix to drink because she's thirsty and the dragon mall didn't have go pieces. Walking the wrong way. Walking the right way. There's pretty people all around. Also ugly. Gates to stop cars but people never stop. The night of cutting off cars. We know people who would fit this scene. I want to go there. I want to go here. No there. Or there. Where? There. There's a bird flying. It's spacey this year. She's a little tipsy. Don't go in the bathroom she's in there. I don't like them

You could randomly cast a smokescreen and abduct scotfree. Cast a tractor beam and enjoy the show

Also there's lasers in the sky
